I recently published my [first podcast](https://b.remarkabl.org/3ibf5eY) along with its [show notes](https://b.remarkabl.org/2FjE7tI).

This article goes over how to upload a podcast without having to pay anything. It assumes you already have the podcast recorded/edited and the cover artwork completed.

- [Upload to a Hosting Platform](#upload-to-a-hosting-platform)
- [Submit to Directories](#submit-to-directories)
  - [Apple](#apple)
  - [Spotify](#spotify)
  - [Google](#google)
  - [Stitcher](#stitcher)
  - [TuneIn](#tunein)

## Upload to a Hosting Platform

Upload your podcast to a hosting platform like [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/). It's free as long as you're within the upload limit; otherwise, you can upgrade to the [pro plan](https://checkout.soundcloud.com/pro).

After your podcast is uploaded, you want to [add your track to your RSS feed](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003451347).

Go to your track and click **Edit** > **Permissions** > **Include in RSS feed**:

![Include SoundCloud track in RSS feed]({{ "/images/2020/2020-09-08-soundcloud-permissions-include-in-rss-feed.png" | prepend: site.assets_path }})

To get the RSS feed URL, go to [Content Settings](https://soundcloud.com/settings/content).

![SoundCloud RSS feed URL]({{ "/images/2020/2020-09-08-soundcloud-settings-content-rss-feed.png" | prepend: site.assets_path }})

The RSS feed URL will look something like:

```
https://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:12345678/sounds.rss
```

For verification to work when submitting your podcast to other directories, make sure to [display your email address in your RSS feed](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003447807):

![SoundCloud email address displayed]({{ "/images/2020/2020-09-08-soundcloud-settings-content-email-address-displayed.png" | prepend: site.assets_path }})

Check out the help article ["Getting started with podcasting"](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003453807-Getting-started-with-podcasting) for more information.

## Submit to Directories

Once your podcast is hosted and the RSS feed is available, you can submit the RSS feed to other podcast directories.

### Apple

1. Create an [Apple ID](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204316).
2. Sign in to [Podcasts Connect](https://itunespartner.apple.com/podcasts/).
3. Podcasts Connect requires an [iTunes Store](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201762) account. If you don't meet this requirement, then sign into [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) with your Apple ID.
4. [Validate](https://podcastsconnect.apple.com/my-podcasts/new-feed) your podcast RSS feed URL.
5. Submit the podcast once the validation status is green.
6. Apple will review your podcast and send an email once the review process is complete.

### Spotify
