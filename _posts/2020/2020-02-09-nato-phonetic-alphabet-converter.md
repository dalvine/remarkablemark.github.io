npm install phonetic-alphabet-converter
```

[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/package/?name=phonetic-alphabet-converter)

## Motivation

I decided to publish another phonetic alphabet package because I couldn't find one that builds to [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd).

My end goal was to build a static site so I wanted to load the library over a CDN instead of setting up a complicated build system.

## Stack

The package is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The setup did take some time initially; but afterwards, I found it simple to use and enjoyed the type checking.

The downside of TypeScript was that it didn't support compiling to UMD with a global variable (see [issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/8436)).

As a result, I had to add [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to the build system. If you're interested in learning how to configure a UMD build with rollup, check out this [article]({% post_url 2019/2019-07-12-rollup-commonjs-umd %}).

Regarding the site, I used [Material Components for the Web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) (MDC Web) as the design system. You can learn more by checking out its [component styleguide](https://material-components.github.io/material-components-web-catalog/).
