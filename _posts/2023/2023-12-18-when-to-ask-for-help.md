How to know when you should ask for help?

Given your work is estimated on a [Fibonacci sequence](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker). For example:

- 1 point = making a copy change
- 2 points = updating a small section
- 3 points = updating a midsize section
- 5 points = updating a big section

You should ask for help when you're stuck after:

- a few hours on work that's 1 point
- 1 day on work that's 2-3 points
- a few days on work that's 5 points

This isn't a hard rule since getting unblocked is always a good thing. So in doubt, ask for help!
