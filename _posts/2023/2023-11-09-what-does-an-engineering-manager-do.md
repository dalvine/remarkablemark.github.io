What's the job of an Engineering Manager? You might say, run [agile ceremonies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/ceremonies) and rituals. Set processes and culture. Document best practices. Hire and train engineers. They all describe the day-to-day activities, but what is the _actual role_?

To answer that question, let's first explain what an Engineer does. An Engineer develops features and fixes bugs for an organization's users. So the more tickets and issues that an Engineer completes, the more value is generated for the business. Given that an Engineering Manager _manages_ Engineers, the role is then obvious—an Engineering Manager _helps_ Engineers generate more _value_ for the business.

Let's try to explain this in another way. An IC (Individual Contributor) takes requirements and writes code. Those are the inputs and outputs. A manager takes ICs and enhances their productivity. Thus, an Engineering Manager's output is his or her direct reports' outputs. That's the ultimate job of a manager—_to make his or her people better_. How that's done, is up to you.
