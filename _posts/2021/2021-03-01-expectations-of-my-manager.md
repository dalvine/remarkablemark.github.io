I expect my manager to be...

## Clear, respectful, and supportive

- I expect to be treated like an adult and not a child
- I expect my manager to have "candor, humility, and trust"
- I expect my manager to be direct and straight with me
  - Don't beat around the bush
- I expect to be autonomous (["Drive" by Daniel H. Pink](https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/))
  - Don't micromanage me ([Theory Y](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_X_and_Theory_Y#Theory_Y))
- I expect my manager to prioritize the team first, and me second
  - Show empathy
  - Help me succeed
    - E.g., identify and provide me with opportunities to grow

## "Kind" rather than "nice"

- I don't want my manager to be a "people-pleaser"
- I expect difficult conversations
  - Constructive conflict is expected and should not be avoided
  - Issues should be confronted immediately
  - I want to be told what I _need_ to hear rather than what I _want_ to hear
    - E.g., why I can't be promoted, [feedback]({% post_url 2022/2022-05-01-how-to-give-feedback %}) on my blunders, etc.

## My "boss" rather than my "friend"

- I expect the relationship to be "professional"
  - A line must be drawn
  - Conflicts of interest must be minimized
- I expect my manager to do what's best for the team
- I expect my manager to hold me accountable

## Decisive

- In a scenario where there are multiple opinions, I expect my manager to be the tie-breaker
- I expect my manager to align the team and create clarity
- I expect my manager to remove blockers and move things forward

Do you agree or disagree with my expectations? What expectations do you have?
