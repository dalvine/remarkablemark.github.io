How do you know when it's time to quit your job? When the following are true:

- [Unhappy](#unhappy)
- [No growth](#no-growth)
- [New opportunity](#new-opportunity)

## Unhappy

If you're bored, unhappy, or unsatisfied with your work and environment, then it's time to reevaluate your status quo. My philosophy in life is that if you're not enjoying something, then you have 2 choices: either (1) _change your mindset_, or (2) _change your environment_. A change can be a breath of fresh air and can reignite your passions.

## No growth

If you've been at a company for quite some time and you feel stagnant, then it's a sign that you've stopped growing. Depending on where you're at in your career, growth is necessary to move up the career ladder and increase your salary. If your company is not providing that, then it may be time to find another company that will.

## New opportunity

Sometimes, opportunities may present itself, like colleagues introducing you to other people, new job offers, and the changing market. This can be a good opportunity to make a vertical move in your career and expand your horizons.

## Conclusion

Quitting one's job is never easy, so weigh your options carefully and perform your due diligence. If you're still on the fence, check out ["When It's Time to Change Careers"]({% post_url 2021/2021-04-29-when-its-time-to-change-careers %}).
