Wouldn't it be nice to run a test that checks for broken links for your site hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)?

With [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com), you can certainly do that!

First, login to [Travis](https://www.travis-ci.com) and _turn on the switch_ for your GitHub Pages repository.

Then add the [html-proofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) gem to your `Gemfile`:

```sh
echo "gem 'html-proofer'" >> Gemfile
```

Create your [Travis configuration](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build):

```sh
touch .travis.yml
```

And add the following:

```yml
language: ruby
rvm:
  - 2.2
cache: bundler
env:
  global:
    # speeds up installation of html-proofer
    - NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES=true
script:
  # replace `.` with the directory path of your site
  - bundle exec htmlproofer .
```

Finally, commit and push your changes to trigger the build on Travis.

If you have a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site, then I recommend checking out the docs on [continuous integration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment/automated/#continuous-integration-service). Feel free to use my [personal site](https://github.com/remarkablemark/remarkablemark.github.io) as a reference.

Also, Travis has a guide on [building a ruby project](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/ruby/).
