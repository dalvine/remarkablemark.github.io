Confidence is the belief and skill of executing an action. When it comes to sports, it's the ability to score a goal. When it comes to public speaking, it's the power to get your message across.

Confident people don't overthink and they perform the activity _naturally_. They are relaxed and not tense. They enter the [zone](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)>) and let muscle memory and instincts take over.

As a result, confident people's mentalities are more focused on _doing it_ rather than _minimizing mistakes_. They have a psychological ability to prevent the _self-inflicted [placebo](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo) effect_.

Confident people work on controlling the variables that can affect the outcome. Once they remove all distractions and emotions, they fall back to the hours of practice and preparation.
