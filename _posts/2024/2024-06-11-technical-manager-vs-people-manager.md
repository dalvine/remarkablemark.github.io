excerpt: The difference between a technical manager and a people manager.
categories: management business organization

A **technical manager** has the _technical know-how_ of the industry, whereas a **people manager** has the _personal know-how_ of the team.

Many times, technical managers were initially individual contributors who were promoted due to their output. People managers, on the other hand, are generalists who studied management but have minimal experience with the product.

Each type has its strengths and weaknesses. If you want a manager who understands the _product and technology_, then hire a technical manager. If you want a manager who understands _social psychology_, then hire a people manager.

Ideally, you want someone with both skillsetsâ€”a manager who not only has the hard skills of the business (IQ), but also the soft skills of dealing with people (EQ).
