Here's a hot take: "Junior Developers should not rely on AI." Why? Because it prevents them from forming _good habits_. Coding is a creative activity that requires you to _think_, and AI trains you to _not think_. Over time, you become a mindless drone that waits for AI's autosuggestion before writing a single line of code. That inevitably causes skill issues.

What's a good analogy to describe this? In terms of working out, using AI for coding is like using steroids for bodybuilding. You can achieve results fast, but you sacrifice your foundation for the long run. When strengthening your body the natural way, you have to be diligent in your workouts, diet, and regime. But with PEDs, you don't have to train as hard to bulk up, but you'll eventually have to pay the price due to side effects.

So instead of learning how to write good code, you're taught to wait for the AI overlord to give you the answerâ€”whether it's right or wrong. Instead of learning how to debug issues and fix your mistakes, you're conditioned like [Pavlovian dog](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) to wait until [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) serves the solution on a silver platter. This leads me to the following question.

"Why are you in this industry if you're avoiding the act of coding?" As noted by the [10,000-Hour Rule](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)>), only _practice makes perfect_. If you're unwilling to struggle and do the hard work, then you should be pursuing something else. To be a professional means having experience. And to have experience means spending the time to acquire it. Would you trust an AI to operate on your body, or a surgeon with a career spanning over a decade? The answer is obvious. If you aren't willing to treat this like a job, then you should reconsider your options.

So does that mean using AI is bad? Of course not. AI can be an invaluable tool to _guide_ someone who has the experience. If you're a Senior Developer who understands the ins and outs of a system, then AI can improve your productivity of menial tasks and chores. For those with experience, AI doesn't eliminate thinking but _speeds it up_.

But if you're a Junior Developer entering this industry, my recommendation is to avoid relying on AI until you become Mid-Level at least. Then you won't be using AI as a crutch, but as a _performance enhancer_.
