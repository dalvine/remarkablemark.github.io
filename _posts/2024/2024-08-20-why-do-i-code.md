Why do others code? For some people, it's because it's their job. It's how they get paid and put food on the table.

For me, it's become the opposite. I code because I enjoy it. Perhaps when I first started, I did it for work. But as the years have gone by, it's become fun—almost therapeutic now.

However, this doesn't mean coding isn't hard or frustrating. Suffering is part of any profession. But I enjoy and embrace the highs and lows.

It's the difference between a writer who writes for a living versus a writer who writes for him or herself. I've reached the latter stage—or what people might call the "coding nirvana." I take pleasure in what I do nowadays, and I'm extremely grateful for that.
