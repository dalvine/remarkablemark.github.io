Change is inevitable during software development. So when developers receive feedback, they can either:

1. Accommodate the request, or
2. Pushback on the request.

The correct choice depends on three factors:

1. What is the seniority of the parties involved?
2. How familiar are they with the codebase?
3. How much context do the developers have?

For junior developers, they may not have a solid grasp of how the application works and may lean on the suggestions of experienced developers. For senior developers, they should have a solid understanding of how the application functions and will insist on their approach if it's well-thought-out.

What makes an approach good? If the approach meets the following:

- Acceptance criteria (requirements)
- Performance (scale)
- Quality (bug-free)
- Security
- Readability/maintainability (good design patterns and architecture)
- Testability

When can a developer pushback on a request for change? If it falls under the following categories:

- Nitpick (optional)
- Invalid/not applicable
- Bad practice (code smell)

So ultimately, knowing when to insist versus accepting a change depends on the value, context, and applicability of the feedback.
